# Smart Speaker

## Overview
Smart Speaker is a virtual home assistant designed to provide information and assist with information.
The current iteration runs on a laptop but we aim to run it on a Rasberry Pi 4 with an external microphone and speaker.
The project uses Anthropic API to generate responses, Pyttsx3 for audio to text interpretation, and OpenAI Whisper to convert user speech to text.
